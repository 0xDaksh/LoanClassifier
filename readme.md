A Classifier Algorithm (Deep Neural Network) built on Keras and Tensorflow that can Classify Users who will take a loan based on their Data which was provided by Kaggle. I built this just to Learn more about Deep Learning. It is Licensed Under MIT, Built with the love for Science, Built by a Node.js Developer for Fun  and That Gives an Accuracy of Around ~90%

# Dependencies
1. Pandas (for Dataframe)
2. Sci Kit Learn (for Data Pre-Processing)
3. Tensorflow (for running Keras with TF Backend)
4. Keras (Deep Learning Library)

# How to Use?

1. Clone or Download the Project from the Fancy Little Clone Button above.
2. Change Directory and enter the `LoanClassifier` folder.
3. Install the Dependencies with PIP or Conda, your Preference. (Please Use Python 3.5.x)
4. Execute the Program with `python LoanClassifier.py` or Run It Directly with Jupyter Notebook
